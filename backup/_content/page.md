The event will return to The Broadmoor Hotel, the longest-running consecutive winner of both the AAA Five-Diamond and Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star awards. Holiday Summit is designed to cultivate extremely valuable relationships between luxury hotels/destinations and qualified (as hand picked by the attending luxury hotels/destinations) decision-making meeting planners who have viable business to bring to this peer group of suppliers.</p><p>The Inaugural Holiday Summit was a sensational success with just under 400 appointments, memorable networking events and working in teams to build 60 bikes, which were donated to <a href="http://christmasunlimited.org" target="_blank">Christmas Unlimited</a>. We are looking forward to building upon this success and growing this event year after year!</p>'
